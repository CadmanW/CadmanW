Hello there, and welcome!
My name is Cadman Warren. Some things I like to do is:

- Videogames
- Code
- Workout
- Skateboard
- Socialize
- Video editing

I'm an up and coming front-end web developer.
I am currently looking for jobs for it aswell!
I'm also pretty good at editing videos for things like gaming, skateboarding, and in general.
I will gladly make websites and edit videos for a very small price, as since I'm still learning i'd love the experience more than the money.
